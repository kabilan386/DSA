# Explanation: This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `searchMatrix` that searches for a target value in a 2D matrix. The matrix is assumed to be sorted in ascending order both row-wise and column-wise. The method uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the target value.


from typing import List

class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        n = len(matrix)
        m = len(matrix[0])

        low = 0
        high = n * m - 1

        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            row = mid // m
            col = mid % m

            if matrix[row][col] == target:
                return True
                break
            elif matrix[row][col] < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1

        return False 
    

print(Solution().searchMatrix([[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], 3))

# Output: True
#
# 
# Time Complexity: O(log(n*m)) where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we are performing a binary search on the entire matrix. 
# Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space for variables.
